# Political Tweets Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the tweets of prominent U.S. politicians to uncover trends, sentiment patterns, and linguistic characteristics before and after major election periods. The analysis aims to provide insights into how political messaging evolves during critical times in the electoral cycle. 

The dataset includes tweets from:
- **Donald Trump**
- **Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez**
- **Bernie Sanders**
- **Josh Hawley**
- **Ron DeSantis**
- **Elizabeth Warren**

The cleaned and processed data has been used to create an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that visualizes tweet frequency, sentiment distribution, word clouds, and other key metrics. This repository also includes the final cleaned dataset (`All_politicians_cleaned_tweets_final.xlsx`) for further exploration or integration into other tools.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning**: Standardize and preprocess raw tweet datasets to ensure consistency and usability.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of tweets (positive, negative, neutral) to understand emotional tone.
3. **Temporal Analysis**: Compare tweet activity and sentiment before and after election periods.
4. **Linguistic Insights**: Extract key nouns and phrases to identify recurring themes in political discourse.
5. **Visualization**: Create an interactive Power BI dashboard to present findings in an accessible and engaging format.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. **Final Cleaned Dataset**
- File: `All_politicians_cleaned_tweets_final.xlsx`
- Description:
  - A unified dataset containing cleaned tweets from all politicians.
  - Columns include: `Date`, `Tweet`, `Politician_name`, `Year`, `Month`, `Day`, `Weekday`, `Nouns`, `Sentiment`, and `Sentiment_Category`.
  - This dataset can be used for further analysis or integrated into visualization tools like Tableau, Excel, or Power BI.

### 2. **Power BI Dashboard**
- File: `Tweet_analysis_dashboard.pbix`
- Description:
  - An interactive dashboard showcasing:
    - Tweet frequency over time.
    - Sentiment distribution by politician.
    - Word clouds highlighting frequently used terms.
    - Comparison of tweet sentiment before and after election periods.
  - Instructions for use are provided below.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- Raw tweet datasets were collected for each politician across multiple years.
- Datasets included metadata such as date, tweet content, and engagement metrics (likes, retweets, etc.).

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Standardization**:
  - Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., image links, video thumbnails).
  - Renamed columns for consistency (e.g., `Content` â†’ `Tweet`).
  - Split tweets separated by line breaks into individual rows.
- **Date Formatting**:
  - Extracted and standardized dates to `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
  - Removed timezone information and ordinal suffixes (e.g., "1st", "2nd").
- **Text Cleaning**:
  - Removed URLs, special characters, and converted text to lowercase.
  - Applied SpaCy's natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to extract nouns and proper nouns.
- **Null Handling**:
  - Dropped rows with missing values to ensure data quality.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Used `TextBlob` to calculate sentiment polarity for each tweet.
  - Categorized tweets as `Positive`, `Negative`, or `Neutral`.
- **Temporal Features**:
  - Extracted year, month, day, and weekday from the `Date` column.
- **Election Periods**:
  - Tagged tweets as occurring `Before` or `After` specific election dates.

### 4. Advanced Analysis
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**:
  - Identified unique keywords associated with each politician using TF-IDF scores.
- **Cosine Similarity**:
  - Calculated similarity between politicians based on their tweet content.
- **Word Clouds**:
  - Generated word clouds to visualize the most common words across all tweets.

### 5. Visualization
- Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to present key findings in an intuitive and visually appealing manner.
